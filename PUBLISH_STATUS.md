# 📦 PUBLISH STATUS - v0.2.1

## 🔍 CURRENT SITUATION

**Issue:** Getting 403 error when trying to publish v0.2.1
```
403 Forbidden - You cannot publish over the previously published versions: 0.2.1
```

**But Also:** Getting 404 when trying to view the package
```
404 Not Found - '@joseph.ehler/wizard-react@0.2.1' is not in this registry
```

## 🤔 WHAT THIS MEANS

This is a **conflicting state** that usually means one of:
1. **Version conflict** - v0.2.1 was published before but is now unpublished/deprecated
2. **Auth issue** - Not logged into npm or wrong account
3. **Scope issue** - The @joseph.ehler scope doesn't exist or you don't have access
4. **npm registry cache** - Temporary propagation delay

## ✅ WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED TODAY

### Code Status:
- ✅ **20 working fields** (14 foundation + 6 composite)
- ✅ **Build: GREEN** (ESM 163KB, CJS 179KB, DTS 21.9KB)
- ✅ **Git: Pushed** to origin/main
- ✅ **Tag: v0.2.1** created

### What's Ready:
- ✅ All code merged to main
- ✅ Package.json at v0.2.1
- ✅ Dist files built successfully
- ✅ All tests passing

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS TO PUBLISH

### Option 1: Check npm Auth
```bash
npm whoami  # Should show your npm username
npm login   # If not logged in
```

### Option 2: Create/Verify Scope
The `@joseph.ehler` scope might not exist. You need to:
1. Go to https://www.npmjs.com
2. Create organization: `joseph-ehler` (with hyphen, not dot)
3. Or publish as public scope

### Option 3: Use Different Scope
Change package.json name to:
```json
"name": "@josephehler/wizard-react"
```
Or publish without scope:
```json
"name": "wizard-react-forms"
```

### Option 4: Manual Publish
```bash
cd packages/wizard-react
npm publish --access public --registry https://registry.npmjs.org
```

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

**Most likely issue:** The `@joseph.ehler` scope doesn't exist on npm.

**Quick fix:**
1. Run `npm whoami` to confirm you're logged in
2. Change scope to `@josephehler` (no dot) in package.json
3. Try publish again

**OR wait until tomorrow** - the package is safe in git, fully working, and ready whenever you want to publish!
