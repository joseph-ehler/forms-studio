# üßê Manual Field Audit Guide: The Artisanal Finish

**Philosophy:** The factory ensures correctness. Humans ensure excellence.

---

## üéØ The God Tier Quality Equation

```
Factory (90%) + Manual Audit (10%) = God Tier ‚ú®

Factory: Objective correctness (ARIA, structure, tokens, consistency)
Humans: Subjective excellence (delight, feel, nuance, empathy)
```

**The factory frees you from checking basics, so your valuable human judgment can focus on what matters: ensuring the final product is not just correct, but truly excellent.**

## üîç WHEN TO AUDIT

### High Priority (Always Audit)

1. **New Recipe First Use**
   - First field generated with a new recipe
   - Example: First SignaturePad after creating SignatureRecipe
   
2. **Major Factory Upgrades**
   - After generator/refiner changes affecting multiple fields
   - After DS primitive updates
   
3. **Complex/Bespoke Fields**
   - SignaturePad, WheelTimePicker, MatrixPlotter
   - Any field using `ui.recipe: custom`

4. **Before Major Releases**
   - Pre-launch quality sweep
   - User-facing critical paths

### Medium Priority (Periodic Spot Checks)

5. **Quarterly Quality Review**
   - Sample 10-15 fields across all types
   - Ensure patterns still feel right
   - Check for subtle degradation

6. **After User Feedback**
   - User reports "feels clunky" or "hard to use"
   - Even if no objective errors exist

7. **High-Traffic Fields**
   - Login form fields
   - Checkout fields
   - Frequently-used search/filters

---

## üîÑ FEEDBACK LOOP PROCESS

### 1. Collect Findings

Document all issues found during audit:
- Screenshot/video of issues
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Subjective assessment

### 2. Categorize Issues

**Objective (Factory Can Fix):**
- Missing ARIA attribute ‚Üí Add refiner rule
- Wrong DS class used ‚Üí Update recipe template
- Inconsistent spacing ‚Üí Update factory overlays

**Subjective (Requires Design Decision):**
- Animation too fast ‚Üí Update DS tokens or recipe
- Microcopy unclear ‚Üí Update content guidelines
- Interaction feels awkward ‚Üí Redesign pattern

**Bespoke (Field-Specific):**
- Unique requirement for this field only
- Mark exception in spec
- Document rationale

### 3. Improve the Factory

**Update Generator/Recipe:**
```typescript
// Before audit:
return {
  element: 'input',
  props: { type: 'text' }
};

// After audit (found animation issue):
return {
  element: 'input',
  props: { 
    type: 'text',
    className: 'ds-input ds-input--smooth-focus' // New class!
  }
};
```

**Add Refiner Rule:**
```javascript
// New rule from audit finding:
export const enforceHelpTextV1 = {
  name: 'enforce-help-text-v1.0',
  description: 'Ensure complex fields have helper text',
  
  run(ast, spec) {
    if (spec.validation?.complex && !spec.ui?.helperText) {
      return {
        changed: true,
        ast: addHelperText(ast, generateDefaultHelper(spec))
      };
    }
  }
};
```

**Update Factory Overlays:**
```yaml
# Based on audit findings:
- when:
    type: email
  merge:
    ui:
      placeholder: 'you@example.com'  # Better placeholder!
      helperText: 'We'll never share your email'  # Reassurance!
```

**Improve DS Primitive:**
```css
/* Add to ds-inputs.css based on audit feedback */
.ds-input--smooth-focus {
  transition: all 200ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1); /* Smoother! */
}
```

### 4. Validate Improvements

- Re-audit after factory changes
- Verify improvements propagated to all affected fields
- Check for unintended side effects
- Document in changelog/ADR
