# Archive - Historical Session Summaries

This directory contains session summaries, debug files, and historical documentation that were created during the development process.

## Purpose

These files are kept for:
- Historical reference
- Pattern analysis
- Architecture decision context
- Debug script examples

## Organization

All files here were created during active development sessions and moved from the root directory to keep the repo clean.

## Active Documentation

For current documentation, see:
- `/docs/` - Living documentation
- `/docs/adr/` - Architecture Decision Records
- `/docs/handbook/` - Developer guides

## Cleanup

These files can be safely deleted after:
- 6 months without reference
- After major version releases
- When patterns are documented in ADRs

**Last cleaned:** 2025-10-23
