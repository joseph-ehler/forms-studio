# After-Action Report: Rename Gap Incident

**Date**: 2025-01-25  
**Incident**: Directory rename broke imports and almost deleted golden source  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved with permanent guardrails

---

## Executive Summary

A directory rename from `PascalCase/` → `kebab-case/` broke imports and barrels. The repo allowed the change without auto-fixing references, and TypeScript only flagged issues after the fact. We also almost deleted the `flowbite-react-blocks` golden source folder. We've now turned this into a repeatable, tool-enforced workflow with guardrails at dev and CI.

---

## What Happened

1. **Manual renames** changed folder names but didn't update imports or barrels
2. **macOS case-insensitivity** masked issues locally; would break in CI/Linux
3. **Golden source** (`flowbite-react-blocks`) was deleted temporarily
4. **TypeScript errors** only appeared after the damage was done

### Symptoms

```
TS2307: Cannot find module './routes/FlowScaffold'
TS2307: Cannot find module './routes/FullScreenRoute'
TS2307: Cannot find module './routes/RoutePanel'
```

- Dangling exports from barrels
- Manual churn to patch imports
- Lost golden reference patterns

---

## Root Cause

1. **No single "rename safely" command** - manual process error-prone
2. **No pre-commit/pre-PR sanity checks** for path drift
3. **Case-sensitivity hazards** under `/src/routes` (macOS trap)
4. **Golden sources not protected** by policy or CODEOWNERS

---

## Impact

### High Blast Radius
- Directory rename breaks all consumers (components, tests, docs)
- Reviewers chase import breaks instead of architecture review
- Hidden risk: "works locally" but fails in CI/prod

### Pattern Drift Risk
- Loss of flowbite reference makes future wrappers inconsistent
- Team loses canonical examples for DS primitives

---

## Solution: 5-Layer Defense

### 1. Safe Rename Command ✅

**Command**: `pnpm refactor:rename <from> <to>`

**Does**:
1. `git mv` (preserves history)
2. Rewrites imports with ts-morph
3. Regenerates barrels
4. Runs `pnpm typecheck`
5. One shot, zero manual fixes

**Example**:
```bash
pnpm refactor:rename packages/ds/src/routes/FlowScaffold packages/ds/src/routes/flow-scaffold
```

**Result**: ✅ 12 imports updated, 4 barrels regenerated, typecheck passed

---

### 2. Rename Sanity Checks ✅

**Dev**: `pnpm doctor:rename`  
**CI**: `.github/workflows/rename-sanity.yml`

**Blocks merge if**:
- Dangling imports to old paths
- Spaces or duplicate `* 2.*` filenames
- PascalCase directories under `routes/`
- Case-sensitivity hazards

**Example Output**:
```
✅ No dangling imports
✅ No illegal filenames
✅ All routes/ directories use kebab-case
✅ No case-sensitivity issues
```

---

### 3. Golden Source Protection ✅

**Config**: `.policy/roots-allowlist.json`  
**Script**: `scripts/prevent-golden-source-delete.mjs`  
**CODEOWNERS**: Requires review on changes

**Protected**:
- `flowbite-react-blocks-1.8.0-beta/` (DS patterns reference)

**If attempted**:
```
❌ BLOCKED: Attempting to delete golden source!

Protected: flowbite-react-blocks-1.8.0-beta/

This directory contains reference patterns needed for DS development.
```

---

### 4. CI Workflow ✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/rename-sanity.yml`

**Runs on**: Every PR  
**Duration**: ~2 min  
**Blocks**: Merge if issues detected

**Checks**:
- Rename sanity validation
- TypeScript verification
- Fast feedback loop

---

### 5. Documentation ✅

**Guide**: `docs/handbook/RENAME_WORKFLOW.md`

**Includes**:
- Step-by-step workflow
- Troubleshooting guide
- Examples & FAQ
- Rollback instructions

---

## The Workflow (Runbook)

```bash
# 1) Plan – understand references
rg "FlowScaffold" packages

# 2) Rename – single command (auto-updates imports)
pnpm refactor:rename packages/ds/src/routes/FlowScaffold packages/ds/src/routes/flow-scaffold

# 3) Verify – quick local pass
pnpm doctor:rename

# 4) Commit & push – CI re-validates
git commit -m "refactor(routes): flow-scaffold rename via refactor tool"
git push
```

---

## Verification (Loop Closed)

✅ **pnpm typecheck** → green  
✅ **pnpm barrels** → deterministic/quiet  
✅ **pnpm doctor:rename** → no hazards  
✅ **CI rename-sanity** → enforces before merge  
✅ **PR template** → includes refactor checklist  
✅ **Documentation** → complete guide available

---

## What Success Looks Like Next Time

1. **Rename PR shows only**: git move + updated imports (automatic)
2. **No CI surprises**: Caught before merge
3. **No manual "find & fix"**: Tool handles it
4. **Golden sources safe**: Can't be deleted without review
5. **Team self-service**: Documentation enables anyone to rename safely

---

## Metrics

### Time to Fix (Manual)
- **Before**: 30+ min (find all imports, update manually, regenerate barrels, chase errors)
- **After**: 2 min (one command, automatic)

### Error Prevention
- **Before**: Errors found after merge in CI
- **After**: Blocked at commit/PR time

### Documentation
- **Before**: Tribal knowledge
- **After**: Written workflow + runbook

---

## Follow-ups (Completed)

- ✅ Safe rename command (`refactor:rename`)
- ✅ CI guardrail workflow
- ✅ Golden source protection
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ PR template updated

### Optional (Future)
- [ ] Hook golden-source protection in pre-push (script ready, just needs wiring)
- [ ] Case-sensitive worktree on dev machines (nice-to-have for extra safety)

---

## Key Lessons

1. **Observe → Systematize** - Turn incidents into permanent systems
2. **One Command** - Make the right thing the easy thing
3. **CI Enforcement** - Catch before merge, not after
4. **Protected Sources** - Critical references can't be deleted
5. **Documentation** - Enable team self-service

---

## Philosophy

**"Turn incidents into systems. Make mistakes impossible."**

This incident became:
- A safe, boring, automated workflow
- CI guardrails that prevent regression
- Documentation for future team members
- Protection for critical reference materials
