# üåç WHY Accessibility Matters - The Human Story

**Purpose**: Understand accessibility as a human right, not a checklist

## üìä The Reality

### WHO We're Building For
- **8% blind or low-vision** - Cannot see your beautiful UI
- **4% color blind** - Cannot distinguish red/green buttons  
- **15% motor disabilities** - Cannot click small targets
- **20% keyboard-only** - Cannot use mouse (power users + disabilities)
- **100% will be temporarily disabled** - Broken arm, bright sun, holding baby

### The Math
**1 billion people worldwide have disabilities** (WHO, 2023)

If you have 10,000 users:
- 800 are blind/low-vision
- 400 are color blind
- 1,500 have motor disabilities
- 2,000 use keyboard only

**Ignoring accessibility = ignoring 20-40% of users**

## üí° Common Myths (BUSTED)

### Myth: "Screen readers are rare"
**Reality**: 8% of users. That's more than Safari users.

### Myth: "Accessibility is expensive"
**Reality**: Costs 10x more to retrofit than build correctly first time.

### Myth: "It makes design ugly"
**Reality**: Netflix, Apple, GitHub are accessible AND beautiful.

### Myth: "We'll add it later"
**Reality**: You won't. And you'll get sued. (see Domino's Pizza lawsuit)

## üéØ WCAG AA Requirements (Human Translation)

### 1. Touch Targets (44√ó44px)
**WHAT**: All buttons/links must be 44px √ó 44px minimum  
**WHY**: Grandma with arthritis can't tap 20px button  
**WHO**: 15% of users (elderly, Parkinson's, motor disabilities)

### 2. Color Contrast (4.5:1 ratio)
**WHAT**: Text must contrast 4.5:1 with background  
**WHY**: Like reading gray text on white paper - impossible in sunlight  
**WHO**: 4% color blind + everyone in bright light

### 3. Keyboard Navigation
**WHAT**: Everything clickable must work with Tab/Enter  
**WHY**: 20% can't use mouse (disabilities, power users)  
**WHO**: Developers, accessibility users, broken arm users

### 4. Labels for Inputs
**WHAT**: Every input needs <label>  
**WHY**: Screen reader says "edit text" not "email field"  
**WHO**: 8% blind users + voice control users
