# Overlay Scroll Bug Fix - October 24, 2025

## üêõ The Problem

**Symptoms reported:**
- Sheet overlay interaction completely broken
- Strange scrolling behavior
- Content appears stuck/frozen
- Can't scroll list of options on mobile

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

Three critical bugs in `ResponsiveOverlay.tsx` were **completely blocking scrolling** in sheet mode:

### Bug #1: `touchAction: 'none'` on Sheet Container
**Location:** Line 227  
**Impact:** **CRITICAL - Blocked ALL touch interactions**

```tsx
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
<div style={{
  ...
  touchAction: 'none'  // ‚ùå Prevents ALL scrolling!
}}>
```

**Why this broke scrolling:**
- iOS/Android interpret `touchAction: 'none'` as "ignore ALL touch events"
- This includes scrolling, tapping, and any interaction
- Content inside the sheet couldn't receive scroll gestures
- Browser completely blocks touch propagation

### Bug #2: `overflow: 'hidden'` on Content Wrapper
**Location:** Line 253  
**Impact:** **CRITICAL - Blocked content overflow**

```tsx
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
<div style={{
  flex: 1,
  overflow: 'hidden'  // ‚ùå Blocks child scrolling!
}}>
  <OverlayContent>  {/* Has overflowY: 'auto' but can't work! */}
```

**Why this broke scrolling:**
- Parent had `overflow: 'hidden'` which clips all overflow
- Child `OverlayContent` has `overflowY: 'auto'` but parent prevents it
- Content physically can't scroll even with correct styles
- Classic CSS overflow containment issue

### Bug #3: Gesture Handlers on Entire Sheet
**Location:** Lines 207-210  
**Impact:** **HIGH - Gesture conflict**

```tsx
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
<div
  onPointerDown={sheetGestures.onPointerDown}  // ‚ùå Captures EVERYTHING
  onPointerMove={sheetGestures.onPointerMove}
  onPointerUp={sheetGestures.onPointerUp}
>
  <OverlayContent>  {/* Never receives pointer events! */}
```

**Why this broke scrolling:**
- Sheet gesture handlers captured ALL pointer events
- Content never received scroll gestures
- `useSheetGestures` has `allowContentScroll` logic but it never ran
- Pointer capture prevented event bubbling to content

## ‚úÖ The Fixes

### Fix #1: Remove `touchAction: 'none'`
```tsx
// AFTER (FIXED)
<div style={{
  ...
  // ‚úÖ Removed touchAction: 'none'
  // Sheet now receives normal touch events
}}>
```

**Result:** Touch events work normally, content can scroll

### Fix #2: Change to `minHeight: 0`
```tsx
// AFTER (FIXED)
<div style={{
  flex: 1,
  minHeight: 0  // ‚úÖ Flexbox fix: allows child to scroll
}}>
  <OverlayContent>  {/* overflowY: 'auto' now works! */}
```

**Result:** OverlayContent can scroll as designed

### Fix #3: Move Gestures to Drag Handle Only
```tsx
// AFTER (FIXED)
<div>  {/* ‚úÖ No gesture handlers here */}
  {dragHandle && (
    <div
      onPointerDown={sheetGestures.onPointerDown}  // ‚úÖ Only on handle
      onPointerMove={sheetGestures.onPointerMove}
      onPointerUp={sheetGestures.onPointerUp}
    >
      <div>Drag Handle</div>
    </div>
  )}
  <OverlayContent>  {/* ‚úÖ Receives gestures naturally */}
```

**Result:** Drag handle works for sheet gestures, content scrolls independently

## üß™ How to Verify the Fix

### Quick Test (30 seconds)
1. **Rebuild packages:**
   ```bash
   pnpm -F @intstudio/ds build
   pnpm -F @intstudio/forms build
   ```

2. **Open demo app:**
   ```bash
   pnpm -F demo-app dev
   # Navigate to http://localhost:5173/#fields
   ```

3. **Test on mobile viewport:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Toggle device emulation (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + M)
   - Set to iPhone or Android device
   - Scroll to "Test Select (Recipe-Based)" field
   - Click to open sheet
   
4. **Verify scrolling works:**
   - ‚úÖ Sheet slides up from bottom
   - ‚úÖ List of options visible
   - ‚úÖ Can scroll content smoothly
   - ‚úÖ Drag handle at top still works
   - ‚úÖ Drag down from handle = expand/collapse
   - ‚úÖ Scroll content = normal scrolling

### Diagnostic Script (Advanced)
1. Open overlay in browser
2. Open console (F12)
3. Paste contents of `scripts/debug/diagnose-overlay-scroll.js`
4. Review diagnostic report
5. Should show: **‚úÖ No issues detected!**

## üìä Before/After Comparison

| Aspect | Before (Broken) | After (Fixed) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Content scroll | ‚ùå Completely blocked | ‚úÖ Works smoothly |
| Touch events | ‚ùå All ignored | ‚úÖ All work |
| Drag handle | ‚ö†Ô∏è Works but blocks content | ‚úÖ Works + content scrolls |
| Gesture conflict | ‚ùå Sheet captures everything | ‚úÖ Proper handoff |
| Mobile UX | ‚ùå Unusable | ‚úÖ Native-feeling |

## üéØ Technical Details

### Why `minHeight: 0` Instead of Removing `overflow`?

In flexbox, when a child has `flex: 1`, it needs `minHeight: 0` (or `overflow: visible`) to allow its children to scroll. Without this:
- Flex item tries to fit all content (no overflow)
- Child's `overflow: auto` can't trigger because parent doesn't overflow
- Classic flexbox + scroll gotcha

Using `minHeight: 0` tells flexbox: "This item can be smaller than its content" which allows the scroll container to work.

### Why Gestures Only on Drag Handle?

The sheet gesture system has logic to allow content scrolling:
```tsx
// useSheetGestures.ts lines 102-107
const canContentScroll = useCallback(() => {
  if (!allowContentScroll || !contentRef.current) return false;
  const content = contentRef.current;
  return content.scrollHeight > content.clientHeight;
}, [allowContentScroll, contentRef]);
```

But this logic only works if the content area receives pointer events! By moving gesture handlers to the drag handle only, we ensure:
1. Content receives its own pointer events
2. Content can scroll naturally
3. Drag handle still controls sheet expansion
4. Proper handoff between sheet and content gestures

## üöÄ Impact

**Scope:** All sheet-based overlays (mobile viewport < 768px)

**Affected components:**
- TestSelectField (recipe-based)
- Any field using ResponsiveOverlay
- Future date pickers, command palettes, etc.

**Severity:** CRITICAL - Completely unusable before fix

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Scrolling fully restored

---

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Never use `touchAction: 'none'` on scroll containers**
   - Blocks ALL touch interactions
   - Use `touchAction: 'pan-y'` or specific directions

2. **Flexbox + scroll requires `minHeight: 0`**
   - Common gotcha with `flex: 1` items
   - Parent needs to allow child overflow

3. **Gesture handlers should be targeted**
   - Don't capture events on entire container
   - Place on specific interaction areas (handles, buttons)
   - Allow content areas to receive events naturally

4. **Test on actual mobile devices**
   - Desktop Chrome DevTools emulation doesn't always catch touch issues
   - Real device testing reveals UX problems
